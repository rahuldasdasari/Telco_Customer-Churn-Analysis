Executive Summary
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Telco Customer Churn, leveraging NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean, visualize, and extract insights from customer churn data sourced from Kaggle. The primary goal is to understand customer churn trends and the factors influencing retention.

üîç Key Analysis and Insights (with Percentages)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
Blank values were replaced with 0, and necessary columns were converted from object to float.
The SeniorCitizen column was converted from (0,1) to ("Yes", "No") for better readability.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Churn Rate Analysis:
26.54% of customers have churned, highlighting a significant retention challenge.
